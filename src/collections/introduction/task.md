## Introduction

This part was inspired by [GS Collections Kata](gs_collections_kata).

Default collections in Kotlin are Java collections,
but there are lots of useful extension functions for them.
For example, operations that transform a collection to another one, starting with 'to':
[`toSet`](to-set) or
[`toList`](to-list).

Implement an extension function `Shop.getSetOfCustomers()`.
The class `Shop` and all related classes can be found at [Shop.kt](shop_file).
